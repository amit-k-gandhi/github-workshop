git pull origin master



-------------------------Branches in Git----------------------

-- list available branches 
git branch

--create new branch 
git branch dev

--switch from master to dev (change working branch)
git switch dev
or 
git checkout dev


--now once we are in new barch DEV which we have created for working
--I have created a new file here and also writing into this git_command file with further learning.
--later we have to merge this change to master over Github

--check logs 
git log --oneline (it will give head where the last change is made)


-- push local dev branch changes over Github in dev branch
git push -u origin dev


-- merge all changes from dev to master in Github
create pull request from Github UI
validate base (where to copy master) <--- compare (from where we copying dev)
once pull request is created. verify the changes.
next, merge the changes. (it will copy all changes rom dev to master)

--once changes are applied to master, we can pull from github master to our local master branch
git pull origin master


-- clone branch (if needed)
git fetch




-- create new working feature branch from dev branch

(ex : I am working on a ticket where I will create new branch to make my change
and later will push it to dev, then in master)

--go and switch to dev branch first.
git switch dev
-- now, create new branch feature101 from dev (like clone branch where we can make our changes)
git checkout -b feature101
